# Proxmox MCP Server Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values

# ============================================================================
# CRITICAL: RISK ACCEPTANCE (REQUIRED)
# ============================================================================
# You MUST set this to 'true' to use this software.
# By setting this to 'true', you acknowledge that you have read and understood
# the DISCLAIMER section in README.md and accept all risks associated with
# giving an AI system SSH access to your Proxmox infrastructure.
#
# See README.md DISCLAIMER section for full details.
I_ACCEPT_RISKS=false

# ============================================================================
# ⚠️ DOCKER/HTTP MODE SECURITY WARNING
# ============================================================================
# When using Docker deployment, this MCP server runs in HTTP mode (Streamable
# HTTP transport) which has NO built-in authentication mechanism.
#
# CRITICAL SECURITY IMPLICATIONS:
# - The HTTP endpoint is completely unauthenticated
# - Anyone who can reach http://host:8000/mcp can control your Proxmox
# - Server only uses credentials below for SSH to Proxmox (not HTTP endpoint auth)
# - No access control, rate limiting, or user authentication
#
# REQUIRED SECURITY MEASURES FOR DOCKER DEPLOYMENT:
# - Bind to localhost only: "127.0.0.1:8000:8000" in docker-compose.yml
# - Use reverse proxy with authentication (nginx with HTTP Basic Auth, Caddy with OAuth2)
# - Deploy behind VPN or use SSH tunneling for remote access
# - Use Docker internal networks to isolate the service
# - Implement firewall rules to restrict access to trusted IPs only
# - NEVER expose port 8000 directly to the internet
#
# For local development with Claude Desktop, use stdio mode instead:
# See README.md "Option A: Using uv (Recommended)" or "Option B: Traditional Python"
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# Proxmox Host Configuration
# ============================================================================
HOST=192.168.1.100
SSH_PORT=22

# SSH Authentication - Choose ONE method:

# Option 1: Password Authentication
SSH_USERNAME=root
SSH_PASSWORD=your_password_here

# Option 2: SSH Key Authentication (comment out password if using this)
# SSH_USERNAME=root
# SSH_KEY=/path/to/your/private_key

# Host Command Execution (OPTIONAL - Advanced Feature)
# ⚠️ WARNING: This enables execution of commands directly on the Proxmox host
# This is DISABLED by default for security. Only enable if you understand the risks.
# When enabled, you can run system-level commands (pct list, pvecm status, etc.)
# See README "Host Command Execution" section for details.
ENABLE_HOST_EXEC=false

# Output Configuration (OPTIONAL)
# Maximum character limit for command output responses
# Default: 25000 characters. Increase for larger outputs, decrease to save tokens.
CHARACTER_LIMIT=25000

# File Transfer Configuration (OPTIONAL)
# Maximum file size for uploads/downloads in bytes
# Default: 10485760 (10 MB). Adjust based on your needs and token limits.
# Examples: 5242880 = 5MB, 10485760 = 10MB, 52428800 = 50MB
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760

# Notes:
# - I_ACCEPT_RISKS: MUST be set to 'true' to use this software (REQUIRED)
# - HOST: IP address or hostname of your Proxmox VE server
# - SSH_PORT: SSH port (default is 22)
# - SSH_USERNAME: SSH user (usually 'root' for full access)
# - SSH_PASSWORD: SSH password for authentication
# - SSH_KEY: Path to SSH private key for authentication
# - Use either SSH_PASSWORD or SSH_KEY, not both
# - ENABLE_HOST_EXEC: Set to 'true' to enable host command execution (default: false)
# - CHARACTER_LIMIT: Maximum characters in command output (default: 25000)
# - MAX_FILE_SIZE: Maximum file size for transfers in bytes (default: 10485760 = 10MB)
