## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints
- Write clear docstrings
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names

### Testing

Before submitting:

- Test with real Proxmox environment
- Verify all tools work correctly
- Check error handling paths
- Test with different configurations

### Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
- Add docstrings to new functions
- Update examples if behavior changes
- Keep comments clear and concise

### MCP Best Practices

When adding tools:

- Use descriptive tool names (snake_case)
- Provide comprehensive docstrings
- Include input validation with Pydantic
- Return structured data (JSON or text)
- Handle errors gracefully with helpful messages
- Add appropriate tool annotations

Example tool structure:

```python
@mcp.tool(
    name="tool_name",
    annotations={
        "title": "Human-Readable Title",
        "readOnlyHint": True,
        "destructiveHint": False,
        "idempotentHint": True,
        "openWorldHint": True
    }
)
async def tool_name(params: InputModel) -> str:
    """Clear description of what the tool does.

    More details about usage, parameters, and return values.

    Args:
        params (InputModel): Description of parameters

    Returns:
        str: Description of return value
    """
    # Implementation
```
